<P><DD>The home course of the MIT Golf Team is Crystal Springs Country Club, located in Haverhill, MA, 34
miles North of Cambridge.

<P><DD>The course is an open park course, with the excpetion of a few holes on the front nine. The front
nine is 3392 yards long from the blue tees, and the back side is 3314 yards long. In
general, the par 3's and 4's are long, while the par 5's are short, providing excellent birdie
opportunities.

<P><DD>The first hole is a medium-length par 4 requiring a precise tee-shot, as the blue tees are located
behind a row of trees. The second hole is a 210 yard par three that usually plays into the wind.
The ball has to land on the gren, as the area in front of it is usually wet, limiting any bounce.
The third hole is uphill, and a long drive is required to have a decent second shot to the green.
The third green has a severe slope, and usually little grass, making it one of the hardest
to put. The fourth hole is the course handicap one hole. It is a almost 90 degree dogleg left. A
well-placed shot off tee of about 200 yards gives a second shot of about 170 yards into the green.
The fourth green is another tough green to sink. The fifth hole is the first par five. A sloping
fairway and out of bounds to the left require a precisely placed tee shot, and most use an iron off
the tee. The second shot needs to be well placed, as the fairway is surrounded by tall trees on both
sides. The sixth hole is another 210 yard par 3. The green is protected by bunkers. The
senventh hole is a fairly short par 4, dog-leg left. Tall trees on the left side make it difficult
to cut the corner, leaving many across the fairway on the right side. The eigth hole is a short par
5, straight ahead, and with two good shots, it is easily reachable in two. Many birdies have been
seen here. The ninth hole is another tough one. It is a long par 4, slight dog-leg right. A good
drive usually still leaves you with a long iron into the green.

<P><DD>The tenth hole is a long, but straight, par 4 that usually does not present too many difficulties
to the players. The eleventh hole is another short par 5, which is sometimes reached in two. The
twelfth is another fairly long par 4 that has out of bounds along the left side of the fairway. The
thirteenth hole is again 210 yard par 3. The green on thirteen is severely sloping, resulting in
too many three-puts. Fourteen is a short dog-leg left par four. A three wood or a two iron usually
leaves you with a wedge shot into the green. The fifteenth is the only hole with real water. You
need to hit about 180 yards to carry a lake, but the second shot is typically only a short wedge
shot. The sixteenth is a 135 par 3, but a sloping green makes it trickier than it looks. The
seventh hole is a long par 4. The tee is set up behind a row of trees that a smart player will
try to hit to the left of. Finally, the eighteenth hole is a short par 5 that is reachable in two
under normal circumstances. However, out of bounds along the right side of the fairway will
penalize those who take too big chances.

<P><DD>The general condition of Crystal Springs is fair. The grass is too long everywhere, and the greens
are not consistent in terms of speed. But, you learn to play them after a while. In August and
September, the greens are acceptable. Unfortunately, Crystal suffers from a bad drainage system. It
is almost always wet, especially in the spring, and this causes bumpy fairways and poor grass growth
