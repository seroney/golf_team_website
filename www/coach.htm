I am a PGA Professional at the Leo J. Martin Golf Course in Weston, which 
is fifteen minutes from campus.  Before getting into the golf business 
nine years ago I attend the Univ.of  Maine where I played on the hockey 
team. I then went on to play three years professionally after 
graduating.   My experience as a student athlete as well as a professional 
athlete has taught me the dedication and commitment level it takes to 
excel. I feel my greatest asset, as a coach is my ability to teach golfers 
of all levels the game of golf both physically and mentally. I understand 
the academic commitment of the MIT student and emphasize that always come 
first. I look for golfers who demonstrate the desire to learn and improve 
and who represent the high standards to which MIT is committed both 
on the course and in the classroom.
