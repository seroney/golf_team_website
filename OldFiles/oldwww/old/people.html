<DD>Joe Kuchta begins his fourth career (third at MIT) as he takes the reins of
the MIT golf program this year. Joe succeeds his long time friend Jack Barry as 
golf coach. Jack spent 24 years at the helm of the program.
<DD>A native of Pennsylvania, Joe enrolled in the Navy out of high school. He
spent 10 years in the service, a good portion of which was in the medical corps
in the South Pacific during World War II. He attended Tufts University after his
honorable discharge in 1948.
<DD>Following his graduation from Tufts in 1952, Joe was employed by MIT in the
research department working on fuel elements for atomic submarines. His medical
training led his supervisors to rely on him for first aid and safety concerns as
the research progressed. He served many MIT departments and satellite facilities
in a safety consulting capacity. He moved into the MIT Safety Office full-time in
the early 1960's.
<DD>Joe retired from the Safety Office in 1986. To prepare for his "retirement",
he took golf lessons from Jack Barry. Jack asked Joe if he would assist with the
intercollegiate golf program and he has been the assistant coach for the last
nine years. <I>[Taken from MIT Sports Annual 1996-97]</I>

<P>
<DD>"I was not able to play much golf in high school because my hometown did not
have a golf course.  My parents allowed me to drive around and play golf the
summer before MIT.  Needless to say, I fell in love with the game and after
further improvements the next summer, I joined the team sophomore year.  It
is extremely gratifying to be the captain after such a short journey.
<BR>
<DD>"My two most memorable experiences as a golfer are the team's trip to
California the spring of my sophomore year because of the fantastic courses
and golf that I played, and the Dartmouth tournament (Hanover CC) the fall
of my junior year.  I started out the first day of play: birdie, par, eagle
and finished the day with a defensive 78.  The eagle came with a blind shot,
5-iron from 190 yards on the first hole (shotgun start) which I never saw go
in.  A group coming down the hill of a nearby hole was going crazy when I
came into sight.  THAT was a great feeling!"

<P>
<DD>"I began playing golf during my junior year in high school as my aunt motivated
my father and myself to take golf classes. Then, golf quickly caught my attention and soon
I was taking classes once a week in a club located half an hour from home. Because of this
distance and since my high school did not have a golf team, I would usually play at most once
a week for the first year and even more sporadically as I finished high school.
<BR>
<DD>"However, I really got to appreciate golf in this first occasion and so I decided
to continue playing once in college. The MIT team has offered me the opportunity to cotniue
developing my skills as I try to finally leave the "beginners" stage. Hopefully I'll get
better as time passes by and help the team perform well in the tournament seasons."

<P>
<DD>"I started playing golf when I was 16.  Since I was the only one in my group of friends who
owned a car, you might imagine that I was often invited to play and learned the game quickly. 
After only one summer aquainence with the malady, I somehow made my high school's varsity team.  My
coach like my enthusiasm, but never once accused me of hitting a fairway.  I received the Golf
Scholar, some say for my grades, but more likely because I could total my scorecard without a
calculator. 
<BR>
<DD>"Although my major is chemical engineering, what I hope someday to be is a lawyer involved
with intellecutal property rights or patent law.  Maybe I could land a job with Callaway and
valiantly defend their Big Bertha patents against Big Brother.  "Go West, young man," is my motto, 
and I hope to find an adaquate law school somewhere in the California/Arizona region.  It is no 
coincidence that these two states have year-round golf-friendly weather and a plethora of fine 
courses.	
<BR>
<DD>"My goal is to grow to be 95 on some blue-collar country club that gives you a six-pack of
Bud whenever you make the turn.  Where me and my 5 friends are going to play in sixums, drag our feet
accross the greens, play 2 balls each, and wait for the green to clear on that 610 yd par 5
before we hit our second shots (even though our drives were only 150; from the back tees).  And I'm 
going to hide behind trees and wait for some kid to forget to replace his diviot, then I'll have
him expelled from the club.  More beer for me.
<BR>
<DD>"Hit it far.  You can't putt anyway."

<DD>"I been playing golf since I was 7, but I've been really playing since 11.  I
made it to the state tournament my junior year in high school with an 82, and
then I shot badly at states.  I will probably work to an M. Eng. in EECS, I'm
not too sure about this yet.  Hopefully I'll get in a career I like and settle 
down with a family.  Perhaps in the future I would like to go back to school 
and get an MBA and go into business."

<P>
<DD>"I've been hitting golf balls since I was about 10 years old.  I played on my
first golf course when I was twelve - on my birthday, in fact.  I broke 80 for my
first time when I went to California my freshman year on our Spring Break
Training Trip.  I have yet to break 70 ... haven't even come close, really.
<BR>
<DD>"A few seasons ago, I played against someone from a high school that used to kick
our high school's butt during the golf matches.  He was pretty good, but we had
the ... uh, shall we say, the Crystal advantage, so I beat him by fifteen
strokes.  Haha, in yo face!  Of course, if we play at a real course, he'll
probably kick my butt again.  This is the time to remember ..."

<P>
<DD>"I've been playing golf since I was 10.  My father started me off and it was a good
way to spend time with him.  One of my first memories of golf was he and I playing together,
 back when I still used his clubs.  I played every year after
that and then in high school I tried out for the team.  When I was a sophomore I
played jv and junior and senior year I played varsity.  A lot of what  I am today
as a golfer is due to my high school coach Joe Bird.  He honed my skills and my
senior year is was second team all conference, first team academic all state, and
we took 4th as a team in state in Wisconsin.  After that I took a 2 year hiatus
from golf to pursue a career in hockey.  After those two years I came back to
school and went to MIT.  I was a little rusty after those two years but with the
guidence of the MIT coach I am working back to my 10 handicap which I had at the
end of my senior year.  I plan to continue playing golf and hockey throughout my
MIT career and hopefully become a major role in the golf team as I am on the
hockey team.  After I graduate in the Brain and Cognitive Science I hope to go to
med school and become a psychiatrist."
